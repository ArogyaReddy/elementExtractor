GitHub Copilot: I understand your frustration. It's common in UI development for changes to have cascading effects, and a more structured approach can indeed bring clarity and reduce rework.

While I can't directly integrate with external project management tools or maintain a persistent state for tracking, I can absolutely help you define a clear plan using the hierarchy you've suggested (Epics, Features, Stories, Tasks, Sub-Tasks). We can then tackle each item systematically, one at a time, through our conversation.

Let's outline a plan based on the issues you've described. You can then copy this into any tracking tool you prefer.

**Project: Element AI Extractor UI Refinement**

**Epic 1: Achieve Full UI Responsiveness and Scalability**
_Goal: Ensure the extension's UI is fully responsive, scales gracefully, and presents information clearly across various popup window sizes._

**Feature 1.1: Responsive Main Popup Container**
_As a user, I want the main popup container to correctly resize from a minimum usable width to a larger width without breaking the layout, so I can use the extension effectively regardless of how I size the popup window._

    **Story 1.1.1: Define Base and Expanded Popup States**
    *As a developer, I need to implement distinct CSS for the popup's initial (non-expanded) and expanded states, ensuring smooth transitions and correct sizing.*
      *   **Task 1.1.1.1: Define CSS for `.popup-root` (Initial/Non-Expanded State)**
          *   Sub-Task 1.1.1.1.1: Determine and set appropriate `min-width` (e.g., `380px` or based on minimal content).
          *   Sub-Task 1.1.1.1.2: Set `width` (e.g., `95%` or `auto` with `margin: auto`).
          *   Sub-Task 1.1.1.1.3: Set `max-width` for the non-expanded state (e.g., `700px`).
          *   Sub-Task 1.1.1.1.4: Set `min-height` for the non-expanded state (e.g., `410px`).
          *   Sub-Task 1.1.1.1.5: Verify `padding`, `margin`, and `box-sizing`.
          *   Sub-Task 1.1.1.1.6: **Testing:** Confirm initial load is compact and responsive within its constraints.
      *   **Task 1.1.1.2: Define CSS for `.popup-root.expanded` (Expanded State)**
          *   Sub-Task 1.1.1.2.1: Set `min-height` for the expanded state (e.g., `660px`).
          *   Sub-Task 1.1.1.2.2: (Optional) Set `max-width` if different for the expanded state.
          *   Sub-Task 1.1.1.2.3: Ensure `transition` properties in `.popup-root` cover all animated properties.
          *   Sub-Task 1.1.1.2.4: **Testing:** Confirm JavaScript correctly toggles the `.expanded` class and visual expansion occurs.
      *   **Task 1.1.1.3: Review and Refine `body, html` Styles**
          *   Sub-Task 1.1.1.3.1: Ensure `width: 100%; min-height: 100vh; box-sizing: border-box;` are set.
          *   Sub-Task 1.1.1.3.2: Remove any fixed `min-width` or `min-height` from `body, html` that might conflict with popup responsiveness.
          *   Sub-Task 1.1.1.3.3: **Testing:** Ensure no conflicts with overall page rendering.

**Feature 1.2: Responsive Filter Controls**
_As a user, I want all filter buttons to wrap correctly and adjust their layout based on the popup width, so all filter options are accessible and readable._

    **Story 1.2.1: Implement Responsive Filter Button Layout**
    *As a developer, I need to ensure filter sections use a responsive layout system (like CSS Grid) that allows items to wrap and utilize available space efficiently.*
      *   **Task 1.2.1.1: Refine Element Type Filters (`.filters`)**
          *   Sub-Task 1.2.1.1.1: Confirm `display: grid;` and `grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(MIN_ITEM_WIDTH, 1fr));` (e.g., `minmax(120px, 1fr)`).
          *   Sub-Task 1.2.1.1.2: Ensure filter items/labels handle text overflow gracefully if they don't wrap text (e.g., `text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap; overflow: hidden; min-width: 0;`).
          *   Sub-Task 1.2.1.1.3: **Testing:** Verify wrapping and readability at various popup widths.
      *   **Task 1.2.1.2: Refine Special Filters (e.g., `.special-filters` or `.row.toggles`)**
          *   Sub-Task 1.2.1.2.1: Ensure these use `display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap;` or a similar grid approach.
          *   Sub-Task 1.2.1.2.2: **Testing:** Verify wrapping and readability at various popup widths.

**Feature 1.3: Responsive Results Table**
_As a user, I want the results table to display content without unnecessary truncation, allowing element names and locators to wrap or be scrollable, so I can read all information._

    **Story 1.3.1: Ensure Table Content Visibility and Responsiveness**
    *As a developer, I need to make the results table and its cells adapt to content and container size, prioritizing readability.*
      *   **Task 1.3.1.1: Make Table Container (`.results`) Responsive**
          *   Sub-Task 1.3.1.1.1: Set `width: 100%;`.
          *   Sub-Task 1.3.1.1.2: Set `overflow-x: auto;` to allow horizontal scrolling if content is excessively wide and wrapping is insufficient.
      *   **Task 1.3.1.2: Make Table Element (`table`) Responsive**
          *   Sub-Task 1.3.1.2.1: Set `width: 100%;`.
          *   Sub-Task 1.3.1.2.2: **Crucial:** Remove any fixed `min-width` (like `min-width: 600px;` from your current `.results table`).
          *   Sub-Task 1.3.1.2.3: Use `table-layout: auto;` or `table-layout: fixed;` appropriately (auto is often better for responsiveness).
      *   **Task 1.3.1.3: Ensure Table Cells (`th`, `td`) Allow Text Wrapping**
          *   Sub-Task 1.3.1.3.1: Apply `word-wrap: break-word;` (or `overflow-wrap: break-word;`).
          *   Sub-Task 1.3.1.3.2: **Crucial:** Remove `max-width` and `overflow: hidden; text-overflow: ellipsis;` from cells if wrapping is the primary goal.
          *   Sub-Task 1.3.1.3.3: **Testing:** Verify with long element names and locators.

**Feature 1.4: Consistent UI Scaling and Readability**
_As a user, I want all UI elements (text, buttons, spacing) to scale harmoniously when the popup size changes, providing a consistent and visually appealing experience._
_ **Story 1.4.1: Standardize Units and Implement Breakpoint Adjustments**
_ **Task 1.4.1.1: Review and Use Relative Units**
_ Sub-Task: Identify fixed pixel values for fonts, paddings, margins that could be `em`, `rem`, or `%`.
_ Sub-Task: Implement changes cautiously.
_ **Task 1.4.1.2: Consolidate and Refine Media Queries**
_ Sub-Task: Review existing media queries for conflicts or redundancy.
_ Sub-Task: Define clear breakpoints if specific layout shifts are needed (e.g., for very narrow popups).
_ **Task 1.4.1.3: Testing:** Holistic review of UI scaling across different popup widths.

This is a comprehensive starting point. We can now pick the first task and work on it.

**Let's start with:**
**Epic 1, Feature 1.1, Story 1.1.1, Task 1.1.1.1: Define CSS for `.popup-root` (Initial/Non-Expanded State)**

Looking at your current CSS for `.popup-root`:

```css
// ...
.popup-root {
  font-size: 12px;
  box-sizing: border-box;
  padding: 12px 12px 6px 12px;
  border-radius: 18px;
  background: #181b22;
  width: 95%;
  max-width: 700px;
  min-width: 380px; // This is a good starting point for a minimum.
  min-height: 410px; // This defines your initial non-expanded height.
  margin: 10px auto;
  box-shadow: 0 2px 30px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4375);
  transition: min-height 0.35s ease-in-out, max-width 0.22s ease-in-out,
    width 0.22s ease-in-out, border 0.35s ease-in-out;
}
// ...
```

And for `body, html`:

```css
// ...
body,
html {
  background: #181b22;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  color: #fff;
  font-family: "JetBrains Mono", "Menlo", "Consolas", monospace, Arial,
    sans-serif;
  min-width: 350px; // This could be problematic.
  min-height: 400px; // This could also be problematic.
  transition: min-height 0.25s;
}
// ...
```

**Sub-Task 1.1.1.1.1 - 1.1.1.1.5 seem mostly defined in your current `.popup-root`.**
The `min-height: 410px;` is your current non-expanded height. If this is correct for the "Initial Load (Not Expanded)" state that you said is FIXED, then these values are good.

**Let's address a potential conflict from Task 1.1.1.3: Review and Refine `body, html` Styles.**
The `min-width: 350px;` and `min-height: 400px;` on `body, html` can restrict the popup's ability to be truly responsive if the browser window for the popup is made smaller than these values. It's generally better to let the content (`.popup-root`) define its own minimums and have `body, html` be more flexible.

**Proposed change for `body, html` (Sub-Task 1.1.1.3.1 & 1.1.1.3.2):**

```css
// ...existing code...
body,
html {
  background: #181b22; /* Assuming this is the desired full background if popup doesn't fill window */
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  color: #fff;
  font-family: "JetBrains Mono", "Menlo", "Consolas", monospace, Arial,
    sans-serif;
  width: 100%; /* Allow body/html to take full available width of the popup window */
  min-height: 100vh; /* Allow body/html to take full available height */
  box-sizing: border-box; /* Good practice */
  /* transition: min-height 0.25s; /* Transition on body/html is unusual and likely not needed here */
}

/* Styles for the main popup container */
.popup-root {
  font-size: 12px; /* Base font size for UI elements within the popup */
  box-sizing: border-box; /* Ensures padding and border don't add to the element's total width/height */
  padding: 12px 12px 6px 12px; /* Inner spacing */
  border-radius: 18px; /* Rounded corners for the popup */
  background: #181b22; /* Background color of the popup itself */

  /* --- Sizing for the initial, non-expanded state --- */
  width: 95%; /* Responsive width, occupying 95% of the popup window's width */
  max-width: 700px; /* Maximum width the popup can grow to in its non-expanded state. */
  min-width: 380px; /* Minimum width to ensure basic layout integrity. */
  min-height: 410px; /* Initial, non-expanded minimum height. This is the height on load. */

  margin: 10px auto; /* Adds some space around the popup and centers it horizontally if the window is wider */
  box-shadow: 0 2px 30px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4375); /* Drop shadow for depth */

  transition: min-height 0.35s ease-in-out, max-width 0.22s ease-in-out,
    width 0.22s ease-in-out, border 0.35s ease-in-out;
}
// ...existing code...
```

This change makes `body` and `html` flexible. The `.popup-root` then defines its own constraints within that flexible space.

What do you think about this first step according to our new plan? This addresses the foundation. Once this is solid, we can move to **Task 1.1.1.2: Define CSS for `.popup-root.expanded`**, which you mentioned is "NOT WORKING".
