Great question!
What you’re seeing (“Preview (first 12):”) is **just a preview** in the UI table. It’s not a bug or an extraction limit—it’s just the front-end **showing only the first 12 results for quick viewing** (to keep the popup/table fast and uncluttered).

---

## 🔎 **How It Works Now**

- **All elements** are being extracted and saved in your data/variable.
- The preview table (in the popup) is **displaying only the first 12 elements** as a “preview.”
- Usually there’s a label/text like:
  `Preview (first 12):`
- The rest of the data is **still available**—for export, copy, or further use.

## ✅ **How to Show All Elements in the Table**

### 1. **Change the maxRows Variable**

Find the code in your table rendering function (likely in `renderElementsTable`):

```js
let maxRows = 12;
```

Change it to something bigger, or use **all**:

```js
let maxRows = data.length; // <-- Shows all elements!
```

Or, if you want a “Show all / Show less” toggle, let me know.

### 2. **Update the Preview Label (Optional)**

Change:

```js
let previewHTML = `<b>Preview (first ${Math.min(maxRows, filteredData.length)}):</b>`;
```

to:

```js
let previewHTML = `<b>Found ${filteredData.length} element${filteredData.length === 1 ? "" : "s"}:</b>`;
```

### 3. **Table Paging/Scrolling (Optional, for large pages)**

- If there are _hundreds_ of elements, consider making the table area scrollable for usability:

  ```css
  .preview-table table {
    max-height: 320px; /* or whatever fits your popup */
    overflow-y: auto;
    display: block;
  }
  ```

- Or implement pagination, but for most use cases, a scroll is enough.

---

## 🚦**Summary of What To Change**

- In `renderElementsTable` (or similar):

  ```js
  // EXISTING CODE:
  let maxRows = 12;

  // TO SHOW ALL:
  let maxRows = data.length;
  ```

- And update the label if you want.
